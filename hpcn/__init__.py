"""
Hierarchical Predictive Coding Network (HPCN)
=============================================

A PyTorch implementation of Hierarchical Predictive Coding Networks inspired by neuroscience.

This package implements a neural network architecture based on the predictive coding theory
from neuroscience, where each layer in a hierarchical network generates predictions about
the activity of the layer below it, and learning is driven by prediction errors.
